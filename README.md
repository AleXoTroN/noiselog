# noiselog

Noiselog is a android application for the german market. If you're experiencing loud neighbors and want to documentate their behavior to reach that to the property management, then you can use noiselog to store the information about the disturbances and export it to a well formatted spreadsheet PDF (that's what the app will be able to do in the future).
